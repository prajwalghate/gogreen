# Buy a phone you can repair

A lot of people are changing their phones because the screen is damage, because they want a better camera or because the battery is not working well anymore.

Changing phone every year is not sustainable and it's bad for the environement. To face this issue, a Dutch company, [Fairphone](https://www.fairphone.com/), is making ethical and modular phone that you can fix and upgrade yourself.

If you are on Android, installing an alternative rom like [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/) can make your old phone faster and increase its lifespan.
