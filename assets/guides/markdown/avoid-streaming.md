# Avoid streaming

Streaming is nice, streaming is amazing, but have you ever though about the consequences on the environement?

To give you an idea on how bad the streaming is, let's take an example. The size of the article text in the English Wikipedia is around [20 gigabytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Size_of_Wikipedia) of data in 2020. It means that everytime you watch a season of the Walking Dead in HD (1080p), you have downloaded on your computer/phone the same amount of data as the entire Wikipedia encyclopedia.

Same applies to Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon and Youtube. Music is much smaller than a HD video but an average user consumes several songs in a day so at the end of the year, the impact of the climate is not negligeable.

Both music and video streaming relies on servers as well as internet infrastuctures to transport the data to you. All of this has a cost, so instead of streaming in all circomstances, try to listen to the radio, go the cinema.... Who knows, you might end up meeting real people in real life!

Don't forget to cancel autoplay by default, leading to unecessary streaming like Youtube is doing. In most video streaming platform, you can save this behavior in the preferences. If you can, use Peertube, a decentralized and open-source video platform, much better for the environement compared to Youtube and more ethical.

If you still want to use YouTube, we recomment [Youtube Focus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-focus/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search), an add-on who tries to promote a healthier watching. As said on their [Github](https://github.com/Jompa14/YouTube_Focus), YouTube has one billion hours whatched daily, and itâ€™s recommendation algorithm generates more than 70% of views. That means 700.000.000 hours every single day. What means that the greatest slice of time that people spend on YouTube isnt because they searched for something to whatch or something to learn, it is because they were sugested by YouTube's algorithm.
